# One HDR Ready

One HDR Ready is a command-line tool that takes a user-inputted gene and processes it using CRISPOR—a tool that predicts off-targets, ranks and filters guide RNAs, highlights problematic guides, and assists with primer design and cloning. Based on the guides generated by CRISPOR, One HDR Ready selects the best guide and generates homology arms for Fast HDR vector and ONE HDR vector method. As well as deisigns primers for verification of DNA insertion.

# Installation

## Step 1: Setting up Command Line Environment

### For Windows Users:
To run this tool, you’ll need a Linux Environment (Ubuntu or Debian) installed on your Windows system.
Follow this easy video tutorial to install Ubuntu (works for both Windows 10 and 11): [How to install Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-DHaQLrBi8&t=2s)

### For Mac and Linux Users:
You can run everything directly from your Terminal.

### Note for First-Time Unix/Linux Users:
If you're new to using the command line, this cheat sheet is a helpful reference for basic Unix/Linux commands: [Linux/Unix Cheat Sheet](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/020-LinuxFundamentals/Student/resources/commands.html)
## Step 2: Install Python and Required Libraries
Open your Terminal (or Ubuntu if you're using Windows).

Navigate to the folder where you want to install the tool.

Install Python if it's not already installed:
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

After installing Python, run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries with the command below
```
pip install requests pandas biopython
```
## Step 3: Install crispor
This tool uses crispor to generate sgRNA sequences.
Follow the installation instructions here: [crispor installation](https://github.com/maximilianh/crisporWebsite/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

### Highly Recommended to set up a Conda Environment
[How to Install Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#macos-linux-installation)

Set-up a Conda environment for python 3.9 in order to install crispor dependencies

### Important:
Do not forget to download the indexed human genome required by crispor. You can obtain it here:
[Index for hg38 Genome (UCSC)](https://crispor.gi.ucsc.edu/genomes/hg38/)

Make sure it's properly placed where crispor can access it, following the guidance in the crispor installation documentation.


## Step 4: Run the Tool
Once crispor is installed and the genome index is downloaded, you can run the program using:
```
python3 CRISPR-Webtool.py
```
You’ll then be prompted to enter the gene you're interested in. The tool will handle the rest.
